## Why you should reset your computer ?

**How to reset computer** depends on what you plan to do with it afterward. If you are keeping the computer, you can proceed directly to resetting the hard drive back to a fresh version of Windows. But if you plan to sell or give the computer away, you'll want to take extra precaution to make sure the data stored on your PC is inaccessible to the computer's next owner.

If you have a hard disk drive (HDD), it will be thoroughly erased when you refresh Windows. But if your computer has a solid-state drive (SSD) — and virtually all computers sold in the last few years do — you'll have to take an extra step to ensure your old data can't be recovered even after it's erased — you should encrypt it.
